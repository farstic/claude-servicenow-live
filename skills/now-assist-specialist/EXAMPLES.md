# Incident Chronology Summariser — Now Assist Skill Design

| | |
|---|---|
| Capability type | Now Assist skill (generative, summarisation) |
| Version | 0.1 |
| Author | Now Assist Specialist |
| Date | 2026-05-09 |
| Release family | Australia |

## 1. Purpose

Generate a 2–3 sentence summary of an incident's history for the itil agent on form load in Service Operations Workspace. The summary draws from the incident's work notes journal, comments journal, audit log of state transitions, and assignment-group changes. Goal: reduce agent ramp-up time on an unfamiliar case.

## 2. Capability statement

Summarise the incident's chronology in 2–3 sentences so the itil agent can ramp up on the case in under 10 seconds.

## 3. Trigger

onLoad Client Script on the `incident` table in Service Operations Workspace. The script invokes the skill via GlideAjax, renders a placeholder ("Loading summary..."), and updates the panel on response.

## 4. Skill type

Discriminative-summarisation (extracts and summarises existing content; does not generate new facts). Implemented as a generative skill in Skill Builder with a strict prompt constraint to avoid factual hallucination.

## 5. Input contract

The skill is invoked with:
- `incident_sys_id` — sys_id of the incident.

The skill retrieves at invocation time:
- `incident.short_description`, `incident.description`, `incident.state` (current).
- Up to 10 most recent `sys_journal_field` entries on the incident (work notes + comments).
- Up to 5 most recent state-change entries from `sys_audit` for the incident.
- Up to 3 most recent assignment changes from `sys_audit` for `incident.assignment_group`.

## 6. Output contract

```json
{
  "summary": "string (2-3 sentences)",
  "confidence": "float 0..1",
  "sources_used": ["work_notes", "comments", "state_audit", "assignment_audit"]
}
```

## 7. Prompt outline

**Role:** "You are a senior ITSM agent's briefing assistant. Your job is to summarise the chronology of an IT incident in 2-3 plain English sentences so a colleague picking up the ticket can ramp up quickly."

**Constraints:**
- Use only the facts in the provided context. Do not invent users, dates, or events.
- If a fact is uncertain, omit it rather than fabricate.
- Use the order: what was reported → what was tried → current state.
- Output a single JSON object matching the output contract.

**Refusal conditions:**
- If the provided context contains zero work notes, comments, or audit entries, return `{"summary": "Insufficient incident history to summarise.", "confidence": 0.0, "sources_used": []}`.
- If the provided context contains content the skill cannot interpret (e.g., embedded attachments, file references), include in summary "additional context attached" rather than hallucinating content.

**Tone:** professional, concise, factual. No emoji, no opinion.

## 8. Confidence and refusal handling

The skill returns a `confidence` score 0..1 reflecting how confident the summarisation is given the source material:

| Confidence | Caller behaviour |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.7 | Render summary in the SOW panel as primary content. |
| 0.4 ≤ c < 0.7 | Render summary in the SOW panel with a "summary may be incomplete" disclaimer. |
| < 0.4 | Render fallback message: "Summary not available — review the work notes directly." |

Refusal (`confidence = 0.0` with the insufficient-history message) renders the fallback message. No autonomous action — this is a read-only display skill, no human-in-the-loop boundary applies.

## 9. AI Control Tower attestation

- **Capability:** Incident Chronology Summariser.
- **Purpose:** Read-only summarisation of incident chronology for itil agent ramp-up.
- **Data classes accessed:** ITSM incident operational data (short_description, description, state, assignment_group, work_notes, comments, audit log). Subject to baseline `incident` ACLs (the caller is the itil agent, so access is already authorised).
- **Output classes produced:** A short-form summary returned to the calling Client Script for in-form rendering. Not persisted.
- **Refusal conditions:** Insufficient history → returns the insufficient-history fallback. Uninterpretable context → omits rather than fabricates.
- **Audit retention:** Skill invocations logged to `sys_log` (baseline Now Assist invocation logging). Retention follows Acme's existing operational log policy (90 days).
- **Periodic review cadence:** Quarterly review of accuracy by Acme ITSM Practice Lead, sampling ~50 invocations per quarter.

## 10. Performance budget

- **Latency target:** p95 ≤ 1.5s end-to-end (GlideAjax round-trip + skill inference + JSON serialisation).
- **Throughput:** ~3,000 invocations/day, ~125 peak per hour, ~3 concurrent in steady state. Well within Now LLM Service throughput envelope.
- **Token count:** input ~500-800 tokens (context summary), output ~80-120 tokens. Cost-efficient.
- **Caching:** per-form-session caching in the Client Script (the Client Script holds the result for the duration of the form session). Server-side caching not used — the summary must reflect the current state of the incident.

## 11. Test strategy

| Test ID | Coverage | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| ATF-ICS-01 | Happy path — incident with rich history | ATF + skill invocation, assert summary length 2-3 sentences, confidence ≥ 0.7. |
| ATF-ICS-02 | Insufficient history | ATF on an incident with zero work notes/comments/audits, assert insufficient-history refusal returned. |
| ATF-ICS-03 | High volume of work notes | ATF on an incident with 50+ work notes, assert summary still 2-3 sentences (no expansion). |
| ATF-ICS-04 | Latency budget | Load test in lower env, 50 concurrent calls, assert p95 ≤ 1.5s. |
| ATF-ICS-05 | AICT attestation validation | Verify `sys_log` entries for skill invocations match attestation data-classes; sample 10 invocations for output review. |
| ATF-ICS-06 | Hallucination resistance | Manual review of 20 random outputs against source material; assert zero invented facts. |

## 12. Open decisions

- **OD-NA-01:** Should the summary include the current SLA breach risk band? Currently no — keeps the skill scoped to chronology. Cross-reference to the `SLABreachRiskCalculator` could be added later as a separate widget.
- **OD-NA-02:** Multilanguage scope is English only per input. If multilingual is added later, the prompt and AICT attestation must be revised.

## 13. Baseline-first audit

| Item | Count | Approval status |
|---|---|---|
| Custom tables proposed | 0 | n/a |
| New scoped apps proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom Action tools proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom Connection Aliases proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom Skill Builder skill (configuration, not custom object) | 1 (Incident Chronology Summariser) | n/a — configuration within baseline Skill Builder framework |
| Custom LLM provider (non-Now LLM Service) | 0 | n/a — uses Now LLM Service |

**Compliance status: COMPLIANT.** The skill itself is configuration in Skill Builder using baseline tables (`incident`, `sys_journal_field`, `sys_audit`) and Now LLM Service. No §1.1 escalation required.

## Downstream handoff manifest

- **Developer** — implements the `IncidentChronologyClient` Script Include (GlideAjax wrapper) and the `Incident Chronology Summary` Client Script (form-load invoker + renderer).
- **Flow Designer Specialist** — not required (invocation is form-load, not flow-triggered).
- **Integration Specialist** — not required (Now LLM Service, no external LLM).
- **UI/UX Specialist** — consult on the SOW panel rendering for the summary (panel placement, loading state, disclaimer styling for confidence < 0.7).
- **ATF Author** — implements the 6 test cases listed in §11.
- **Performance & Scale Specialist** — does not fire at this volume.
- **Security & GRC Specialist** — does not fire (standard ITSM data, no PII flags beyond baseline ACL coverage).
```

### §6.2 post-build manifest

> *Capability design produced. The Incident Chronology Summariser is a baseline Skill Builder skill using Now LLM Service — no custom objects, no orchestration flow, no external integration. Proposing handoffs:*
>
> 1. **Developer** — implements `IncidentChronologyClient` Script Include and `Incident Chronology Summary` Client Script — proceed?
> 2. **UI/UX Specialist consult** — SOW panel rendering pattern (placement, loading state, confidence-based disclaimer styling) — proceed?
> 3. **ATF Author** — six test cases including hallucination resistance — proceed?
>
> **Baseline-first audit: COMPLIANT.** No custom objects.
>
> **No §1.1 escalation.** No Performance & Scale or Security & GRC consults fire.
>
> **No Code Reviewer trigger** — this artefact is a capability design, not code.

### Explanation

This is a clean baseline-first Now Assist design. The skill itself lives in Skill Builder (a baseline framework), uses baseline tables (`incident`, `sys_journal_field`, `sys_audit`), and consumes the Now LLM Service. The Baseline-first audit explicitly clarifies that the custom Skill Builder skill is **configuration within a baseline framework, not a major custom object under §1.1** — that nuance is important for Now Assist work because almost every Now Assist deliverable involves creating a "custom skill" in the colloquial sense.

The AI Control Tower attestation is non-optional and is the governance layer that makes the capability deployable: it specifies data classes accessed, output classes produced, refusal conditions, and audit retention. Without an AICT attestation, the skill cannot ship.

The confidence routing is explicit: ≥ 0.7 renders as primary content, 0.4–0.7 renders with a disclaimer, < 0.4 renders a fallback. No implicit thresholds. This is the Phase 2.2 discipline that distinguishes a buildable design from a "ChatGPT but for incidents" hand-wave.

Hallucination resistance gets its own ATF test (ATF-ICS-06) because that's the operational risk for a summarisation skill — the prompt constraint says "use only the facts in the provided context", but the test verifies that across 20 random invocations.

## Example 2 — AI Agent: Duplicate Case Detection with §1.1 escalation

### Input prompt

> Now Assist Specialist task: design an AI Agent that detects duplicate CSM cases on case submission. When a customer submits a new case via the portal, the Agent compares it to recent cases for the same account and, if it finds a likely duplicate at high confidence, proposes deflection to the customer. If low confidence, the case proceeds as normal.
>
> Module: CSM.
> Trigger: case-submission webhook from the customer portal.
> Tools: must read `sn_customerservice_case` (baseline), must compare semantic similarity (custom Action? baseline AI Search?), must propose deflection to the customer.
> Volume: ~10K case submissions/month.
> Sensitivity: customer-supplied content; treat as potentially containing PII.
> Multilanguage: English + Mandarin + Japanese.
> Pre-approved custom objects: none.
> Release family: Australia.

### Expected output (with §1.1 escalation)

# Duplicate Case Detection Agent — AI Agent Design

| | |
|---|---|
| Capability type | AI Agent (one-shot, per case submission) |
| Version | 0.1 (draft — BLOCKED on §1.1 escalation, see §13) |
| Author | Now Assist Specialist |
| Date | 2026-05-09 |
| Release family | Australia |

## 1. Purpose

Compare a newly-submitted customer case against the customer account's recent cases (~30 days) and, on high-confidence match, propose deflection by surfacing the existing case to the customer before the new case is created. Reduces duplicate case volume and improves customer experience.

## 2. Capability statement

Detect likely duplicate case submissions at submission time and propose deflection to the customer when confidence ≥ 0.85.

## 3. Trigger and lifecycle

One-shot per case submission. Invoked by the customer portal submission flow (Flow Designer Specialist designs that flow separately) before the case record is created. Agent terminates after returning a verdict (`duplicate_found` with reference, or `proceed_with_submission`).

## 4. System prompt outline

**Role:** "You are a customer service triage assistant. Your job is to detect when a customer is submitting a case that is functionally identical to a recent case on the same account, and recommend deflection to the existing case."

**Constraints:**
- Use only the data in the provided context (the new case's subject and description, and the candidate matches retrieved from AI Search).
- A "duplicate" means the same underlying issue, even if worded differently. A "related case" or "follow-up" is NOT a duplicate.
- If uncertain whether two cases are duplicates, lean towards NOT-duplicate (false positive is more harmful than false negative — sends the customer back to a case that isn't actually theirs).
- Output a single JSON object matching the output contract.

**Refusal conditions:**
- If candidate matches are empty (no recent cases on the account), return `{"verdict": "proceed_with_submission", "confidence": 1.0}`.
- If the new case content is too short to assess (< 10 words), return `{"verdict": "proceed_with_submission", "confidence": 0.5}` with a note that low-content cases are not assessed.

**Tone:** internal — agent's verdict is not customer-facing directly. The portal renders the customer-facing UX based on the verdict.

## 5. Tools / Actions available

| Action | Type | Purpose | Side-effect class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getRecentCasesForAccount` | **Baseline** (Read Records via standard CSM spoke) | Retrieve up to 50 cases on the account, last 30 days, active states only. | Read-only. |
| `semanticSearchCases` | **CUSTOM — §1.1 ESCALATION REQUIRED** | Compare the new case's text against the candidate cases via semantic similarity (AI Search profile). | Read-only. |
| `proposeDeflection` | **Baseline** (Update Record via standard CSM spoke) | Write to the deflection-event tracker (see §13). | Write — limited. |

**OPEN QUESTION — CUSTOM OBJECT PROPOSAL (§1.1):** see §13 — the `semanticSearchCases` Action and the deflection-event tracker each require Chief Architect approval before this design can be implemented.

## 6. Confidence routing

| Confidence (`duplicate_found` verdict) | Agent behaviour |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.85 | Return `{verdict: "duplicate_found", existing_case_sys_id: <sysid>, confidence: <c>}`. Portal renders deflection UI to customer. |
| 0.6 ≤ c < 0.85 | Return `{verdict: "uncertain_duplicate", existing_case_sys_id: <sysid>, confidence: <c>}`. Portal renders a "you may have submitted this before — see <existing case>" link but allows submission to proceed. |
| < 0.6 | Return `{verdict: "proceed_with_submission", confidence: <c>}`. Portal proceeds with case creation as normal. |

## 7. Human-in-the-loop conditions

- **PII handling** — the new case's subject/description may contain PII. The Agent does not log raw case content beyond the AI Control Tower attestation's audit scope (see §9). Customer-supplied content is never displayed back to other customers — the deflection UI shows the *existing* case's sanitised summary, not the new case's content.
- **Customer-facing communication** — the Agent itself does not communicate with the customer. The portal renders the customer-facing UX based on the verdict. This is an intentional separation: the Agent is internal-only.
- **First-time customer scenario** — if the account has zero recent cases, the Agent returns proceed-with-submission without invoking the LLM (saves cost and latency).

## 8. Memory and context

The Agent is one-shot per case submission. It retains no memory across invocations. Each submission is evaluated in isolation.

## 9. Multilanguage scope

English, Mandarin (Simplified), Japanese — per engagement requirement. The system prompt is English; user-facing content (the new case subject/description and candidate cases) is in the customer's language. AI Search profile must be configured for multilingual semantic matching — see §13 for the AI Search configuration cross-reference.

## 10. AI Control Tower attestation

- **Capability:** Duplicate Case Detection Agent.
- **Purpose:** Detect duplicate case submissions at submission time and propose deflection.
- **Data classes accessed:** Customer-supplied case content (potentially PII); CSM case records on the customer's own account; AI Search results.
- **Output classes produced:** Verdict (duplicate / uncertain / proceed) with reference to existing case; written to the deflection-event tracker for analytics.
- **Refusal conditions:** Empty candidate list → proceed. Low-content new case → proceed with note. Inability to interpret content (binary attachments, garbled text) → proceed with confidence flag.
- **Audit retention:** Verdict and confidence logged per submission to the deflection-event tracker (see §13). Raw LLM input/output retained for 30 days per Acme operational policy, then purged. The new case content itself is in the `sn_customerservice_case` table per baseline retention.
- **Periodic review cadence:** Monthly review of false-positive rate by Acme CSM Practice Lead. Sample 100 verdicts per month.

## 11. Performance budget

- **Latency target:** p95 ≤ 3s end-to-end (perceptual budget for "customer waits at submission"). Tight.
- **Throughput:** ~10K invocations/month, ~330 per business day, ~40 per business hour at peak.
- **Token count:** input ~800-1200 tokens (new case + 5-10 candidate cases), output ~50-80 tokens.
- **AI Search latency:** must complete within 800ms to allow the LLM call to fit in budget.

## 12. Test strategy

| Test ID | Coverage | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| ATF-DCD-01 | High-confidence duplicate | ATF + mock: new case "VPN not connecting" + recent case "Cannot connect to VPN" on same account — assert verdict=duplicate_found, confidence ≥ 0.85. |
| ATF-DCD-02 | Low-confidence non-match | ATF + mock: new case "Email outage" + recent cases on unrelated topics — assert verdict=proceed_with_submission, confidence < 0.6. |
| ATF-DCD-03 | Empty candidate list (new customer) | ATF: new customer's first case — assert short-circuit return, no LLM invocation. |
| ATF-DCD-04 | Low-content case | ATF: new case with subject="help" and 5-word description — assert verdict=proceed with low-content note. |
| ATF-DCD-05 | Multilingual happy path | ATF in Mandarin and Japanese — assert duplicate detection works across the engagement's supported languages. |
| ATF-DCD-06 | Latency budget | Load test, 50 concurrent submissions, assert p95 ≤ 3s. |
| ATF-DCD-07 | False-positive sampling | Manual: monthly review of 100 verdicts, assert false-positive rate < 5%. |
| ATF-DCD-08 | AICT attestation validation | Verify deflection-event log entries match attestation data-classes; sample 20 entries per month. |
| ATF-DCD-09 | PII leakage prevention | Manual: verify deflection UI shows the *existing* case's sanitised summary, NOT the new case's raw content. |

## 13. Open decisions and OPEN QUESTION — CUSTOM OBJECT PROPOSAL

### OQ-CUSTOM-01: Semantic similarity tool

**Baseline option evaluated:** AI Search is the baseline ServiceNow semantic search capability. It supports custom search profiles, multilingual configurations, and RBAC integration. **Baseline option is sufficient — the `semanticSearchCases` Action wraps AI Search and is NOT a custom object.**

**Correction:** the entry in §5 was overcautious. AI Search consumption is baseline functionality; the Action that invokes it is configuration in AI Agent Studio, not a custom object under §1.1.

**Outcome:** no §1.1 escalation required for this item.

### OQ-CUSTOM-02: Deflection-event tracker

**Baseline option evaluated:** the customer portal's existing deflection-event tracker (`x_acme_csm_portal_deflection_event` from the prior CSM portal deflection design — see `clients/acme/csm/customer-portal-deflection-design.md`). That table was pre-approved under §1.1 in a prior dispatch.

**Outcome:** REUSE — no new custom object proposed.

### OQ-CUSTOM-03: AI Search profile for multilingual semantic case matching

**Baseline option evaluated:** AI Search supports multilingual profiles via baseline configuration. A new search profile (sn_search_profile) is configuration, not a major custom object — analogous to creating a new dashboard or report.

**Outcome:** configuration within a baseline construct, no §1.1 escalation required.

### Open decisions (non-§1.1)

- **OD-NA-DCD-01:** Confidence threshold of 0.85 is the design default. Acme CSM Practice may want to tune this based on early production data. Recommend monitoring false-positive rate in the first 90 days and adjusting.
- **OD-NA-DCD-02:** Sanitised summary format for the deflection UI — owned by UI/UX Specialist. The Agent does not produce the sanitised summary; the portal renders existing case data.
- **OD-NA-DCD-03:** Mandarin and Japanese support requires AI Search profile testing in those languages on representative case data. Plan a multilingual content sample before go-live.

## 14. Baseline-first audit

| Item | Count | Approval status |
|---|---|---|
| Custom tables proposed | 0 | n/a (reuses pre-approved `x_acme_csm_portal_deflection_event`) |
| New scoped apps proposed | 0 | n/a (reuses pre-approved `x_acme_csm_portal`) |
| Custom Action tools proposed | 0 | n/a (revised — `semanticSearchCases` wraps baseline AI Search) |
| Custom Connection Aliases proposed | 0 | n/a |
| Custom Skill Builder skill / AI Agent (configuration) | 1 AI Agent | n/a — configuration within AI Agent Studio |
| Custom AI Search profile (configuration) | 1 | n/a — configuration within AI Search |
| Custom LLM provider | 0 | n/a — uses Now LLM Service |

**Compliance status: COMPLIANT.** Design uses configuration within baseline frameworks (AI Agent Studio, AI Search, AICT) and reuses pre-approved custom objects from the prior CSM portal deflection design. No new §1.1 escalation.

---

## Downstream handoff manifest

- **Flow Designer Specialist** — designs the portal submission flow that invokes the Agent (separately).
- **Developer** — implements the deflection-event tracker write (already specified in prior CSM portal design).
- **Integration Specialist** — not required (Now LLM Service, baseline AI Search).
- **UI/UX Specialist** — sanitised summary rendering in the deflection UI (see OD-NA-DCD-02).
- **ATF Author** — 9 test cases including PII leakage prevention.
- **Performance & Scale Specialist** — consult on the 3s perceptual latency budget at expected volume.
- **Security & GRC Specialist** — consult on AICT attestation given customer-supplied content and multilingual scope.
```

### §6.2 post-build manifest

> *Capability design produced. The Duplicate Case Detection Agent is a baseline AI Agent in AI Agent Studio, using baseline AI Search for semantic matching and Now LLM Service for verdict generation. Reuses pre-approved custom objects from the prior CSM portal deflection design.*
>
> **Proposing handoffs:**
>
> 1. **Flow Designer Specialist** — designs the portal submission flow that invokes the Agent before case creation — proceed?
> 2. **UI/UX Specialist consult** — sanitised summary rendering pattern for the deflection UI (OD-NA-DCD-02) — proceed?
> 3. **Performance & Scale Specialist consult** — 3s perceptual latency budget at ~10K/month volume — proceed?
> 4. **Security & GRC Specialist consult** — AICT attestation given customer-supplied content + multilingual scope — proceed?
> 5. **ATF Author** — nine test cases including PII leakage prevention and multilingual coverage — proceed?
>
> **Baseline-first audit: COMPLIANT.** All custom-object references resolved during design — see §13 OQ-CUSTOM-01..03.
>
> **No Code Reviewer trigger** — this artefact is a capability design, not code.

### Explanation

This example demonstrates two key Phase 2.2 Now Assist disciplines:

1. **The §1.1 escalation flow done correctly.** The initial design (§5) listed `semanticSearchCases` as a CUSTOM Action requiring escalation. The §13 evaluation walked through the baseline option (AI Search) and concluded the Action is actually configuration in AI Agent Studio wrapping baseline AI Search — no escalation required. The Baseline-first audit (§14) reflects the corrected position. This is exactly the discipline the rule is designed to produce: surface the question, evaluate baseline first, then proceed only if baseline is genuinely insufficient.

2. **Cross-design reuse.** OQ-CUSTOM-02 explicitly reuses the `x_acme_csm_portal_deflection_event` table that was pre-approved in a prior dispatch (the CSM portal deflection design from Technical Designer's Example 3). This is the "smallest viable scope" discipline — don't propose a new custom object when an already-approved one fits.

The confidence routing has *three* bands rather than two (≥ 0.85 deflect, 0.6–0.85 advisory link, < 0.6 proceed) — a more nuanced operational pattern that matches the risk: at high confidence, force the deflection; at medium, offer it but allow submission; at low, get out of the way. The human-in-the-loop section explicitly separates the Agent's role (internal verdict) from the portal's role (customer-facing UX) — that architectural separation prevents PII leakage (ATF-DCD-09) and limits the Agent's blast radius.

The multilingual scope (English, Mandarin, Japanese) drives both prompt design and AI Search profile configuration. Mandarin and Japanese are not just "Western language but Asian" — they have different morphology and case structure, which affects semantic similarity scoring. OD-NA-DCD-03 calls out the need for a multilingual content sample before go-live rather than assuming the AI Search profile will "just work".

# HR Case Summariser — AI Control Tower Governance Attestation

| | |
|---|---|
| Capability type | AICT governance attestation (referencing existing Now Assist skill) |
| Version | 0.1 |
| Author | Now Assist Specialist |
| Date | 2026-05-09 |
| Release family | Australia |
| Referenced skill | HR Case Summariser (existing, design ref: `clients/acme/now-assist/hr-case-summariser-design.md`) |

## 1. Capability under attestation

**HR Case Summariser** — a Now Assist generative skill that produces a 2–3 sentence summary of an HR case's history for an HR business partner viewing the case in Employee Center or HR Case Workspace.

## 2. Purpose

Reduce HRBP ramp-up time on an unfamiliar HR case by generating a chronological summary from the case's existing audit trail and work notes. Read-only. No autonomous action.

## 3. Data classes accessed

The skill accesses:

| Data class | Tables / fields | Sensitivity | ACL coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee identity | `sn_hr_core_profile.first_name`, `last_name`, `employee_number`, `email` | HR PII | Baseline `sn_hr_core_profile` ACLs; HRBP role enforced. |
| Employee organisational position | `sn_hr_core_profile.manager`, `department`, `location` | HR PII | Same. |
| HR case content | `sn_hr_core_case.subject`, `description`, `state`, `priority`, `assignment_group` | HR PII (case may contain sensitive content) | Baseline `sn_hr_core_case` ACLs. |
| HR case audit | `sys_journal_field` entries on `sn_hr_core_case` (work notes, comments) | HR PII | Baseline. |
| HR case state audit | `sys_audit` entries for `sn_hr_core_case.state` changes | HR PII | Baseline. |

**Explicitly NOT accessed (out of scope for this skill):**

| Data class | Reason for exclusion |
|---|---|
| Employee compensation | `sn_hr_core_profile.salary` is not in the skill's input contract. Attempted access is blocked by skill configuration and additionally by baseline ACLs (HRBPs do not read salary in baseline HRSD). |
| Performance ratings | Same — explicitly excluded from input contract. |
| Termination data | Same. |
| Health / medical information | Same. |

## 4. Output classes produced

A single text string (2-3 sentences) returned to the calling form panel. **The output is not persisted** — it is rendered transiently in the HRBP's session and discarded when the HRBP closes the case.

The skill invocation itself is logged to `sys_log` (baseline Now Assist invocation logging) with: invocation timestamp, calling user, case sys_id queried, latency. The output text itself is NOT included in the invocation log.

## 5. Refusal conditions and override conditions

**Refusal:**
- Insufficient case history (zero work notes, zero comments, zero state changes) — skill returns "Insufficient case history to summarise."
- Caller does not have the HRBP role — skill refuses to return any output. This is enforced both by the skill's role check and by baseline ACLs on the underlying tables.
- Case state is "Closed — Confidential" (Acme-specific state for sensitive HR investigations) — skill refuses to summarise. The HRBP must read the case directly with the appropriate explicit ACL clearance.

**Override conditions:**
- None. The skill is read-only with no autonomous action. There are no override conditions because there are no actions to override.

## 6. Audit retention policy

| Item | Retention | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Skill invocation log (sys_log entries) | 90 days (per Acme operational log policy) | Auto-purged. |
| Skill output text | Not retained — rendered transiently. | Not applicable. |
| Underlying case data | Per baseline `sn_hr_core_case` retention (engagement-specific). | Per baseline. |
| AICT attestation document | Indefinite — superseded versions retained for compliance trail. | Manual review on superseding. |

## 7. Periodic review cadence

| Review | Frequency | Owner |
|---|---|---|

## 8. Open decisions

- **OD-AICT-01:** The 30-day audit window referenced in the prior design draft has been corrected to 90 days here per Acme's actual operational log policy. Confirm with Acme Security Lead.
- **OD-AICT-02:** "Closed — Confidential" state value is referenced but the underlying state-model design has not been confirmed for this engagement. If the state does not exist, the refusal condition must be revised. Reference: HRSD Specialist consult on baseline HR case state model.

> 2. **HRSD Specialist consult** — OD-AICT-02 references the "Closed — Confidential" state which may not be baseline; confirm state-model assumption before sign-off — proceed?

> **Baseline-first audit: COMPLIANT.** The attestation is governance documentation, not a new capability or custom object. No §1.1 escalation.

### Explanation

This example is shorter and tighter because AICT attestations have a focused structure — they're not capability designs, they're governance documents.

The discipline shown here is **explicit exclusions** in §3 — listing what the skill does NOT access (compensation, performance, termination, health) alongside what it does access. For HR PII especially, this is critical: the attestation is what Security & GRC will review, and "trust us, we don't read salary" is rejected. The exclusion table makes the boundary auditable.

§5's "Override conditions: None" is also a Phase 2.2 discipline — every section must be populated. "Not applicable" with a rationale is correct; silence is rejected.

§8 (Open decisions) catches a real risk: the attestation references a "Closed — Confidential" state that may not be baseline. Rather than assert it exists, the attestation flags it as OD-AICT-02 and routes back to HRSD Specialist for verification. This is the honest-uncertainty pattern: the Now Assist Specialist designs the AICT attestation but doesn't pretend to know Acme's HR state model.
