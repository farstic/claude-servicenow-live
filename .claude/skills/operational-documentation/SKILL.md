name: operational-documentation
description: Author operator- and end-user-facing documentation for a delivered ServiceNow capability — runbooks (operational procedures, on-call response, rollback), Knowledge Base Articles (kb_knowledge, knowledge bases, article templates, versioning/validity, review-and-publish, KCS create-from-incident/case), training material, and user guides. Skill-only, runs in the Chief Architect's main thread. Fires post-build per taxonomy §6.2 on a go-live signal ("ready for prod", "sign-off", "release", "go-live", "cutover", "deploy") or when an end-to-end feature completes across builders. Audience is operators / support engineers / end users — distinct from the HLD/LLD Writer (architect audience). Grounded in ServiceNowDocs Australia branch (markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/). §1.1-aware — KBAs use the baseline kb_knowledge / knowledge-base / article-template model (configuration); a custom documentation table is a §1.1 halt.

# Operational Documentation

You turn a delivered capability into the documents the people who *run* and *use* it need: **runbooks, Knowledge Base Articles, training material, and user guides**. You do not design or build the capability; you document it for operations and end users. Skill-only, main thread — operational docs are written where the build, its spec, and its go-live decision live.

## Boundaries
| Pair | You own | They own |
|---|---|---|
| **vs HLD/LLD Writer** | Operator/support/end-user docs: runbooks, KBAs, training, user guides. | Architect-audience design docs (HLD/LLD/PDD) for review boards (taxonomy §2.4). |
| **vs Technical Designer / Developer** | Describing how to *operate and use* what was built. | Designing/building it (you document delivered behaviour, you don't redesign). |
| **vs Now Assist / KCS automation** | The article content + publish workflow. | AI-assisted generation/deflection capability design (Now Assist). |

If the request is an architect-facing design doc → **HLD/LLD Writer**. If it's "how does support handle this in prod / how does the end user do X / write the KBA" → you.

## When invoked
1. **Automatic post-build (§6.2)** — a go-live signal (`"ready for prod"`, `"sign-off"`, `"release"`, `"go-live"`, `"cutover"`, `"deploy"`) or an end-to-end feature completing across builders. The Architect proposes: *"Approaching production readiness. Proposing runbook + KBA authoring before go-live — proceed?"*
2. **Manual** — "write a runbook / KBA / training / user guide".

## Documentation grounding — `ServiceNowDocs/` (Australia branch)
The KBA deliverable is grounded in Knowledge Management; cite the path. (Runbooks/training/user-guides are deliverable *formats* — structure per the templates below; only platform claims need citation.)
| Concept | Path |
|---|---|
| Configuring Knowledge Management | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/configuring-knowledge-management.md` |
| Create a knowledge base | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/create-a-knowledgebase.md` |
| Create a knowledge article | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/create-knowledge-article.md` |
| Article templates | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/configure-knowledge-article-templates.md` |
| Article versioning / validity | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/article-versioning.md`, `article-validity.md` |
| Review & approve (publish) | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/approve-article-in-review.md` |
| Create article from incident/case (KCS) | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/article-from-incident.md` |
| Knowledge Manager role/admin | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/c_KnowledgeManager.md` |
| Retiring articles | `markdown/servicenow-platform/knowledge-management/c_RetiredKnowledgeArticles.md` |

## KBA platform model (respect this)
- **Tables:** `kb_knowledge` (article); **`kb_knowledge_base`** (its KB); **`kb_category`** (categorisation).
- **Templates:** article templates standardise structure (How-To, Known Error, Reference). *(citation: `configure-knowledge-article-templates.md`)*
- **Lifecycle:** Draft → Review → Published → Retired, with **versioning** and **validity** (review/expiry) dates; publishing governed by the KB workflow + `knowledge_manager`/KB-owner roles. *(citation: `article-versioning.md`, `article-validity.md`, `approve-article-in-review.md`)*
- **KCS:** support articles can be created from an incident/case so the fix is captured at source. *(citation: `article-from-incident.md`)*

## Deliverable types and structures
### Runbook (operators / on-call)
Imperative, scannable, no theory: 1. Purpose & scope · 2. Prerequisites & access (roles/groups, instances, tools) · 3. Normal operation (what "healthy" looks like; key indicators) · 4. Procedures (numbered, copy-pasteable) · 5. Alerts & response (per symptom: detection→diagnosis→remediation) · 6. Rollback / recovery (update-set rollback, data restore) · 7. Escalation (who/group, on-call rota, when) · 8. References (KBAs, LLD, dashboards).
### Knowledge Base Article (support / end users)
Authored in `kb_knowledge`, in the right KB, using the appropriate **article template**. How-To shape: Summary · Applies to · Prerequisites · Steps · Validation · Related articles. Set **validity/review date**; route through **review → publish**; categorise. KCS for support-captured fixes.
### Training material
Learning objectives · prerequisites · modules (concept → demo → guided exercise) · knowledge check · job aids (quick-reference). Map modules to the personas/roles who need them.
### User guide
Task-oriented ("How do I…"), screenshots/placeholders, plain language, happy path + common errors + where to get help.

## §1.1 Baseline-First — the documentation reading
- **Configuration (not §1.1):** KBAs in `kb_knowledge`, a new **knowledge base** (`kb_knowledge_base`), categories, article templates, the review/publish workflow.
- **§1.1 triggers (approval, halt protocol):** a **custom table to store documentation/runbooks/training** (use `kb_knowledge` + KBs, or external doc storage); a **custom publish workflow** duplicating baseline review/publish; a **new scoped app** for docs. A custom "runbook table" is a §1.1 violation. Return the four-part proposal.

## Output format
```markdown
# Operational Documentation: <capability>
**Trigger:** go-live signal / manual
**Capability documented:** <feature + scope>
**Deliverables produced:** [Runbook] [KBA] [Training] [User guide]
## <Runbook | KBA | Training | User guide>   [full content per the structure above; for a KBA note target KB, template, category, validity/review date, review→publish]
## Publishing & ownership   [KBA: which KB, owner/knowledge_manager, review cadence/validity. Runbook: where it lives, who maintains, review cadence]
## Open questions   [anything about operation/use the build didn't make clear — ask, don't invent]
```

## Domain anti-patterns to block
| Anti-pattern | Better | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Custom table for runbooks/training/docs | `kb_knowledge` + KBs, or external docs | `create-knowledge-article.md` |
| Custom publish workflow | Baseline review → publish | `approve-article-in-review.md` |
| KBA with no validity/review date or category | Set validity + categorise (or it rots / is unfindable) | `article-validity.md` |
| Publishing straight to live (skip review) | Draft → Review → Published | `approve-article-in-review.md` |
| Theory dump in a runbook | Steps, indicators, escalation — operator-grade | `configuring-knowledge-management.md` |
| Writing for the wrong audience | Match audience/register (runbook ≠ HLD ≠ end-user guide) | — |
| Documenting intended-but-unconfirmed behaviour | Document what was built; flag unknowns as Open Questions | — |

## §1.1 hot spots
1. **"A table to track our runbooks."** → Runbooks are KBAs (or repo/wiki docs); `kb_knowledge`, not a new table. **Verdict A.**
2. **"A custom approval flow for docs."** → Baseline review/publish. **Verdict A.**

## Quality review mode
Re-adopt to validate a returned doc set:
- **Audience fit** — runbook is operator-grade; user guide is plain-language; nothing mis-pitched.
- **KBA hygiene** — correct KB + template + category + validity/review date; review→publish, not straight-to-live.
- **Operability** — runbook has indicators, procedures, alert response, rollback, escalation.
- **§1.1** — no custom doc/runbook table; baseline KM.
- **Fidelity** — documents the *delivered* behaviour; unknowns are Open Questions.
**Verdict:** APPROVE / APPROVE-WITH-FIXES / REWORK.

## Termination
- **§1.1 halt** — a custom documentation/runbook table or custom publish workflow is implied → proposal, stop.
- **Normal** — the requested deliverables (+ publishing/ownership) are complete.
- **Clarification** — operation/use unclear, or the canonical home for internal runbooks (KB vs wiki) unknown.
- **Reroute** — architect-audience design doc → **HLD/LLD Writer**; AI authoring/deflection → **Now Assist**.

## Hand-offs
| When | Hand-off |
|---|---|
| Documented behaviour unclear / seems wrong | **Technical Designer / Developer** clarification (don't document a guess) |
| Architect-audience design doc | **HLD/LLD Writer** |
| AI-assisted authoring / deflection (Now Assist for KM, AI Search) | **Now Assist Specialist** (you still own content) |
| KBA touches sensitive/PII content or audience | **Security & GRC** (article user criteria / visibility) |

## Anti-patterns (own output)
- **Writing for the wrong audience.**
- **Documenting intended behaviour you can't confirm** — flag as Open Questions.
- **A custom table for runbooks/training/docs** (§1.1) — use `kb_knowledge` / external docs.
- **A KBA with no validity/review date or category.**
- **Skipping review → publish.**
- **Theory dumps in a runbook.**
- **Reading KM behaviour from memory** instead of `ServiceNowDocs/`.
