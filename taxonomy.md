# taxonomy.md — Specialist Boundaries and Routing Resolution

> **Purpose:** Authoritative reference for resolving routing ambiguity between specialists. When a user task could plausibly route to two or more specialists, the boundary tables and trigger-keyword maps in this document determine which specialist is correct.
>
> **Read by:** CLAUDE.md (Tier 2 orchestrator), master-project-instructions.md (Tier 1 master), each satellite project's instructions, and the Chief ServiceNow Architect persona at routing time.
>
> **Maintenance:** Updated whenever a new specialist is added or whenever a real misroute is observed in production use.

## 0. Global governance rules — authoritative reference

This taxonomy operates under the global architecture rules in `governance-rules.md`. The Chief Architect and every specialist must comply with all rules in that file.

**§1.1 — Baseline-First / Zero Custom Objects Without Explicit Approval.** No specialist may propose, design, or create custom tables, custom scoped applications, custom state-model extensions, custom Connection & Credential Aliases, or any other major custom architectural object without the Chief Architect's explicit, prior approval in the routing-time dispatch envelope. If a specialist concludes that a custom object is genuinely the only viable technical path, it must halt and return a blocking `OPEN QUESTION — CUSTOM OBJECT PROPOSAL` per the halt protocol in `governance-rules.md` §1.1.

§1.1 is enforced at two phases of the resolution algorithm:

- **Routing-time (§6.1):** the Chief Architect surfaces custom-object evaluations as Phase 1 assumptions. Custom objects implied by the user's request are raised as blocking OPEN QUESTIONS before specialist dispatch.
- **Post-build (§6.2):** the Chief Architect inspects every returned artefact for §1.1 violations as part of the post-build evaluation. A detected violation triggers a rework dispatch before any other consult proposals.

**§2.1 — MCP Write Operations Explicit Approval Gate.** Every MCP write operation against a live ServiceNow instance requires an explicit "write approved" from the user in the current conversation before execution. Tier upgrade, prior approvals, and logical flow do not substitute. See `governance-rules.md` §2.1.

**§2.2 — MCP Update Set Capture Mandatory Pre-Write Protocol.** Before any configuration write via MCP, the `sys_user_preference` record (`name=sys_update_set`) for the authenticated user must be set to the target Update Set. Without this, objects are not captured and cannot be promoted. See `governance-rules.md` §2.2.

See `governance-rules.md` for the full text of all rules, halt protocols, and violation handling.

## 1. Specialist roster overview

The system's 22 specialists fall into four functional groups:

### Builders — Tier 2 sub-agent execution

## 2. Boundary tables — pairwise specialist boundaries

When a task could plausibly route to two or more specialists, this table determines which one wins. The boundary is stated as a *trigger differentiator*: a property of the task that distinguishes the two specialists' jurisdictions.

### 2.1 Builder boundaries

| Pair | Boundary principle | Trigger differentiator | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Technical Designer** vs **Developer** | Designer produces *spec*; Developer produces *implementation*. | Output type. Spec / design doc / architecture decision → Designer. JavaScript code / Glide script / actual implementation → Developer. | "Design the X" → Designer. "Implement the X" / "Write the code for X" → Developer. |
| **Developer** vs **Flow Designer Specialist** | Developer = scripting in `.js` files. Flow Designer Specialist = Flow Designer flows, subflows, custom Action Designer scripts. | Where the logic lives. Script Include or Business Rule → Developer. Flow definition or custom Action → Flow Designer Specialist. | "Write a Script Include for X" → Developer. "Design a flow that does X when Y" → Flow Designer Specialist. |
| **Developer** vs **App Engine Specialist** | Developer writes scripts. App Engine Specialist designs custom scoped applications, App Engine Studio components, decision tables, document templates. | Granularity. Script-level work → Developer. Application-architecture work → App Engine Specialist. | "Write the validation logic for table X" → Developer. "Design a scoped app for the X workflow" → App Engine Specialist. |
| **Integration Specialist** vs **Migration Specialist** | Integration = ongoing, steady-state. Migration = one-time, project-phase. | Temporality of the data flow. Continuous bidirectional/unidirectional sync → Integration. One-time historical load with cutover → Migration. | "Sync ServiceNow with Azure DevOps" → Integration. "Migrate Remedy incidents into ServiceNow" → Migration. |
| **Integration Specialist** vs **Flow Designer Specialist** | Integration designs the *integration architecture* (REST messages, IntegrationHub spokes, MID Server, authentication, error handling). Flow Designer designs the *orchestration* that uses those integrations. | What's being designed. The endpoint, payload, auth, retry logic → Integration. The flow that calls the endpoint as a step → Flow Designer. | "Design the REST integration with Azure DevOps" → Integration. "Design the flow that triggers the Azure pipeline when a CHG is approved" → Flow Designer. |
| **ATF Author skill** vs **ATF Author sub-agent** | Skill = inline single-component test generation. Sub-agent = batch test-suite generation across an app. | Scope. One method / one Script Include → skill. Whole scoped app → sub-agent. | "Write ATF for ConflictAssessmentUtils" → skill. "Generate the full ATF suite for the x_acme_itsm app" → sub-agent. |

### 2.2 Reviewer boundaries

| Pair | Boundary principle | Trigger differentiator | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Code Reviewer** vs **Performance & Scale Specialist** | Code Reviewer runs four checklists on existing code. Performance & Scale Specialist designs *for* scale upfront, or *audits* designs against scale assumptions. | Direction of analysis. "Review what's written" → Code Reviewer. "Design for X volume" or "will this hold at X TPS" → Performance & Scale. | "Review this Script Include" → Code Reviewer. "Design this to handle 10M records" → Performance & Scale. |
| **Code Reviewer** vs **Security & GRC Specialist** | Code Reviewer's security checklist covers common code-level security issues. Security & GRC Specialist designs ACL strategies, RBAC, audit logging, GRC controls. | Concern depth. Code-level security issues (injection, missing role check) → Code Reviewer. Architectural security (ACL strategy, RBAC model, GDPR control) → Security & GRC. | "Review this code for security issues" → Code Reviewer. "Design the ACL model for the new scoped app" → Security & GRC. |

### 2.3 Domain expert boundaries

| Pair | Boundary principle | Trigger differentiator | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ITSM/CSM/HRSD/ITOM** vs **Discovery Specialist** | Domain specialists own *platform-specific* knowledge of their module. Discovery owns the *process* of eliciting client requirements. | What's being asked. Platform behaviour, table model, baseline configuration, anti-patterns → domain specialist. Workshop facilitation, current-state capture, transcript extraction → Discovery. | "Design the incident escalation model" → ITSM Specialist. "Run a workshop on the current incident process" → Discovery. |
| **ITOM/Discovery Specialist** vs **CMDB & CSDM Specialist** | ITOM/Discovery covers MID Server, Discovery probes/sensors, Service Mapping, Event Management. CMDB & CSDM covers CI Class Manager, CSDM phase alignment, IRE rules. | Scope. Operational ITOM (Discovery, monitoring, mapping) → ITOM/Discovery. Data model and CMDB integrity → CMDB & CSDM. | "Configure Discovery for cloud workloads" → ITOM/Discovery. "Design IRE rules for the application service class" → CMDB & CSDM. |
| **Now Assist Specialist** vs **Flow Designer Specialist** | Now Assist owns the *intelligence* design (AI Agents, agentic workflows, Now Assist skills, AI Control Tower). Flow Designer owns the *orchestration* design (flows, subflows, custom actions). | Intelligence vs orchestration. The AI Agent itself, prompts, tools, governance → Now Assist. The flow that invokes the agent or runs without intelligence → Flow Designer. | "Design the AI Agent for duplicate detection" → Now Assist. "Design the flow that triggers the duplicate detection agent on incident insert" → Flow Designer. |
| **Now Assist Specialist** vs **ITSM/CSM/HRSD Specialists** | Now Assist owns AI capability design across modules. Domain specialists own the underlying records, processes, table models. | Where the intelligence sits. Anything Now Assist–badged (skill, agent, agentic workflow) → Now Assist. The incident lifecycle, case routing, HR LE → respective domain. | "Design the Now Assist skill that summarises an incident" → Now Assist. "Design the incident escalation rules" → ITSM. |

### 2.4 Consultant and documentation boundaries

| Pair | Boundary principle | Trigger differentiator | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discovery Specialist** vs **Story Writer** | Discovery is divergent (open-ended workshops, gap analysis). Story Writer is convergent (Gherkin, sprint-ready). | Output shape. Process map / requirements list / gap analysis → Discovery. Gherkin Feature file / acceptance criteria / sprint story → Story Writer. | "Run a workshop on X" / "Extract requirements from this transcript and structure them" → Discovery. "Write Gherkin stories for X" / "Sprint-ready stories" → Story Writer. |
| **Discovery Specialist** vs **Technical Designer** | Discovery defines *what*. Technical Designer defines *how*. | Question type. "What does the customer need" → Discovery. "How do we build it in ServiceNow" → Technical Designer. | "What's the gap between current and target state" → Discovery. "How do we structure the table model for the target state" → Technical Designer. |
| **HLD/LLD Writer** vs **Operational Documentation** | HLD/LLD = enterprise design documents for review boards (audience: architects). Operational Documentation = runbooks, training, KBA, user guides (audience: operators, end users). | Audience. Architects, reviewers, sign-off panels → HLD/LLD. Operators, support engineers, end users → Operational Documentation. | "Write the HLD for X" → HLD/LLD. "Write a runbook for X" / "Author a KBA for X" / "Create training for X" → Operational Documentation. |
| **HLD/LLD Writer** vs **Process Design Document author** | PDDs are operational process descriptions. They sit between architectural designs and runbooks. | We do not have a separate PDD specialist. PDDs route to HLD/LLD with explicit "PDD format" instruction, OR to Operational Documentation if the audience is operators rather than architects. | "Write a PDD for the change management process" → HLD/LLD with PDD section template. "Write the process the GSC follows when a P1 lands" → Operational Documentation. |

## 3. Cross-cutting consult relationships

Some specialists are explicitly *consulted by* others rather than competing for the routing slot. Consults are evaluated at two distinct points: (a) at routing time, before the primary specialist is invoked; and (b) at post-build time, after a builder sub-agent returns its artefact. The Chief ServiceNow Architect persona must surface both types of consult at the appropriate phase of the resolution algorithm (§6).

### 3.1 Routing-time consults

Evaluated by the Chief Architect *before* the primary specialist is invoked, as part of the routing protocol.

| Consultant specialist | Consulted by | Trigger condition |
|---|---|---|
| **Performance & Scale Specialist** | Technical Designer, Developer | Volume estimates exceed 1M records, async/batch design choices, instance scaling questions, query patterns on large tables. |
| **Security & GRC Specialist** | Technical Designer, Developer, Integration Specialist | Non-trivial ACL design, PII handling in scope, SecOps pattern involvement, GDPR or regulatory controls, integration with sensitive external systems. |
| **DevOps / Release Manager** | Technical Designer, App Engine Specialist | When new scoped apps are designed (update set strategy, App Repository workflow, deployment pipeline). |

> **Note — CMDB & CSDM promoted to gateway (v2.0).** CMDB & CSDM Specialist was formerly a routing-time consult here. It is now a mandatory Phase 1 Step 5 / §6.1 Step 7 Domain Expert gateway (`skills/cmdb-csdm-specialist/SKILL.md`) that fires automatically on CMDB/CSDM/IRE/service-model triggers (§4.4) and produces a 5-Part Constraint Envelope. It co-fires with the ITOM/Discovery gateway when a task spans CI population and CI model (ITOM owns population; CMDB & CSDM owns the model).

### 3.2 Post-build consults

Evaluated by the Chief Architect *after* a builder sub-agent returns its artefact, *before* the artefact is presented as final to the user.

| Consultant specialist | Triggered by completion of | Detection signal | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Domain Expert gateway** (ITSM / CSM / HRSD / ITOM / CMDB & CSDM — skill only) | Any builder sub-agent whose task was routed through a Domain Expert gateway at Phase 1 Step 5 | Task was domain-tagged at routing time (incident, problem, change, SLA, case, HR case, Discovery, CMDB/CSDM/IRE/service-model, etc.) | Re-adopt the same Domain Expert skill in review mode (Phase 2 Step 4). Validate the returned artefact against the Constraint Envelope produced at Phase 1 — confirm no baseline construct has been silently replaced by a custom object, and all table/field/state references are consistent with the Envelope's Data Model Alignment. If a deviation is found, surface it as a §1.1 violation and re-dispatch the builder with findings before surfacing any other post-build proposal. |
| **Code Reviewer** (skill only — no sub-agent) | Developer sub-agent; or any builder that emits server-side or client-side script (Flow Designer Specialist custom Action scripts, App Engine Specialist business rules, ATF Author step scripts) | Returned artefact contains a JavaScript code block (Script Include, Business Rule, Client Script, UI Script, Scheduled Job, custom Flow Action script, ATF step script). | Chief Architect proposes Code Reviewer handoff verbatim: *"Code artefact produced. Proposing a Code Reviewer pass (style, performance, security, best-practice) before final delivery — proceed?"* On approval, adopt Code Reviewer skill in main thread (no sub-agent dispatch) and run the four checklists against the artefact. |
| **ATF Author** (skill or sub-agent) | Developer, Flow Designer Specialist, App Engine Specialist | New code or flow definition returned and the artefact is destined for a release path (i.e., not throwaway analysis or PoC). | Chief Architect proposes: *"Build artefact produced. Proposing ATF coverage before sign-off — single-component (skill) or full-app suite (sub-agent)?"* |
| **Operational Documentation** | Any builder, when feature is approaching production readiness | User signal of imminent go-live (`"ready for prod"`, `"sign-off"`, `"release"`, `"go-live"`, `"cutover"`, `"deploy"`); or completion of an end-to-end feature spanning multiple builders. | Chief Architect proposes: *"Approaching production readiness. Proposing runbook + KBA authoring before go-live — proceed?"* |

These post-build consult triggers are **mandatory**: the Chief Architect must surface the proposal even if the user did not request it. The user may decline, but the offer must be made.

## 4. Trigger-keyword map

When the user's task contains certain keywords or phrases, the router has a strong prior toward one specialist. This map is consulted *after* boundary resolution; it's a tiebreaker for the close calls.

## 5. Anti-routing rules

Explicit "do not route X to Y" cases to prevent known confusion.

| Rule | Reason |
|---|---|
| Do NOT route "design a Flow that uses an AI Agent" entirely to Now Assist Specialist. | This task has two parts. The Flow design goes to Flow Designer Specialist; the AI Agent design goes to Now Assist Specialist. The Chief Architect must split it. |
| Do NOT route "review this code for security issues" to Security & GRC Specialist. | Code-level security review belongs to Code Reviewer's security checklist. Security & GRC is for architectural security design, not code review. |
| Do NOT route "extract requirements from this transcript and write Gherkin stories" entirely to either Discovery or Story Writer. | This is a two-step task. Discovery extracts the requirements; Story Writer converts them to Gherkin. The Chief Architect must sequence both. |
| Do NOT route "implement and review this Script Include" to Developer in one shot. | Developer writes; Code Reviewer reviews. Two specialists, two passes, two artefacts. |
| Do NOT route "build a runbook" to HLD/LLD Writer. | HLD/LLD has architect audience; runbooks have operator audience. Different style, different structure. Operational Documentation owns this. |
| Do NOT auto-route "Azure DevOps" to Integration Specialist without checking context. | Could be: integration design (Integration), pipeline orchestration (Flow Designer), DevOps tooling (DevOps/Release Manager). Read the task. |
| Do NOT route "what does the customer need" to Technical Designer. | That's a Discovery question. Technical Designer answers "how do we build it." |
| Do NOT route "design for high volume" to Code Reviewer. | Forward-looking design questions go to Performance & Scale. Code Reviewer reviews what already exists. |
| Do NOT skip the §6.2 post-build evaluation when a code-emitting builder sub-agent returns. | The Code Reviewer consult is mandatory whenever code is generated. Even if the user did not ask for review, the proposal must be surfaced. The user may decline, but the offer must be made. |

---

## 6. Resolution algorithm

The algorithm runs in two phases: routing-time (steps 1–9, before specialist invocation) and post-build evaluation (steps 10–14, after a builder sub-agent returns).

### 6.1 Routing-time phase

1. **Read the task verbatim.** Identify all noun phrases and verb phrases.
2. **Apply trigger-keyword map (§4)** to identify candidate specialists.
3. **If only one candidate** — propose that specialist. Skip to step 7.
4. **If multiple candidates** — apply the relevant boundary table (§2) using the trigger differentiator.
5. **If still ambiguous** — apply anti-routing rules (§5) to eliminate impossible routes.
6. **If still ambiguous after §5** — the task may legitimately require *multiple* specialists in sequence. Propose a sequenced plan: "Specialist A produces X, then Specialist B consumes X to produce Y."
7. **Apply the Domain Expert gateway (mandatory).** Check whether the task falls within a domain covered by a v2.0 gateway (ITSM, CSM, HRSD, ITOM, CMDB & CSDM — see §4.4 domain triggers). If yes, load and adopt the relevant Domain Expert skill before dispatching any builder. The Domain Expert produces its 5-Part Constraint Envelope (OOB Process Map · Data Model Alignment · §1.1 Verdict · Routing Recommendation · Anti-Patterns). **Multiple gateways co-fire** for cross-domain tasks (e.g., CSM ↔ ITSM ↔ CSDM) — reconcile their envelopes into one dispatch context. For the CMDB & CSDM ↔ ITOM/Discovery boundary, ITOM owns CI *population* and CMDB & CSDM owns the CI *model*; fire both only when the task spans both. No builder sub-agent is dispatched until every Envelope is produced and the §1.1 Verdict is resolved. Verdict C (custom object required) is a hard stop — surface the OPEN QUESTION and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding.
8. **Surface routing-time consult relationships (§3.1).** Mention any cross-cutting consultants whose trigger conditions fire. Do not invoke them yet — surface them as part of the proposal.
9. **Stop and wait** for user approval before proceeding to specialist invocation.

### 6.2 Post-build evaluation phase

Triggered when a builder sub-agent returns an artefact, *before* the artefact is presented as final.

10. **Inspect the returned artefact.** Classify content: code block, flow definition, configuration, pure design.
11. **Check for §1.1 violations.** Scan the artefact for new table names (`x_*_*` or non-baseline `<scope>_<table>`), new scoped app prefixes, new Connection & Credential Aliases, new state values, or new sys_user_group structures that were not approved in the dispatch envelope. If any are found, halt immediately and re-dispatch the originating builder with the §1.1 halt protocol as the rework brief. Do not proceed to step 12 until the violation is resolved.
12. **Domain Expert post-build review (domain tasks only).** If the task was routed through a Domain Expert gateway at Phase 1 Step 7, re-adopt the same Domain Expert skill in review mode and validate the artefact against the Constraint Envelope (§3.2, first row). If a deviation is found, re-dispatch the builder with findings. Do not proceed to step 13 until the Domain Expert clears the artefact.
13. **Evaluate remaining post-build consult triggers (§3.2).** For each remaining post-build consult whose detection signal matches the artefact (Code Reviewer, ATF Author, Operational Documentation), prepare a consult proposal using the verbatim Action wording from §3.2.
14. **Present artefact + consult proposals together.** The user receives the builder's artefact alongside a clearly labelled set of post-build consult proposals. The user chooses which to invoke.

If no post-build consult triggers match (e.g., Technical Designer returned a pure design doc with no code and the task had no domain tag), step 14 still runs but contains zero proposals — the artefact is presented as final.

## 7. Maintenance

This document is updated when:

- A new specialist is added to the roster.
- A real misroute is observed in production use (add to §5 anti-routing rules).
- A new trigger keyword pattern emerges (add to §4).
- ServiceNow ships a major release that changes terminology meaningfully (add new keywords, deprecate old ones in a `RELEASE NOTES:` block at the bottom of relevant tables).

Updates are committed to git with a clear message: `taxonomy: <change-summary>`.
