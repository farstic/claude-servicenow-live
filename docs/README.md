**Repository:** [`farstic/claude-servicenow-live`](https://github.com/farstic/claude-servicenow-live)
**Purpose:** The entry point to the engine's documentation suite — what the engine is, and which document to read for what.
**Audience:** Everyone. Start here, then branch by role.
**Last updated:** 29 May 2026

> A virtual ServiceNow consulting team — powered by Claude — that writes stories, designs, code, and test suites, **validates them against a live ServiceNow instance**, and deploys approved work under strict change control — without ever silently inventing a custom table.

---

## What the engine does

Type a ServiceNow request. The engine routes it through the right specialist, checks it against ServiceNow's out-of-the-box capabilities (now confirmed against the **live instance schema**, not just the manuals), produces the deliverable, runs an automatic quality review, and — when you approve — **deploys it directly to your instance** inside a tracked Update Set.

| You get | How |
|---|---|
| **Sprint-ready user stories** | Story Writer produces Gherkin with acceptance criteria and the supporting stories you forgot |
| **Architecture you can ship** | Domain Experts (ITSM · CSM · HRSD · ITOM) check every request against baseline ServiceNow before approving any custom build |
| **Code with a built-in review** | Every JavaScript artefact gets an automatic style + performance + security + best-practice check |
| **Live validation and deployment** | Reads the real instance to confirm baseline; deploys approved artefacts directly — gated by write approval and Update Set capture |
| **No accidental tech debt** | The engine refuses to silently invent custom tables — it stops, shows the baseline alternatives, and waits for your decision |
| **No ungoverned writes** | Nothing reaches the instance without an explicit, named "write approved" — and everything lands in an Update Set |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code CLI (one-time)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Clone the engine (with submodules — pulls the ServiceNow reference docs)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/farstic/claude-servicenow-live
cd claude-servicenow-live

# 3. Run it
claude
```

At the `❯` prompt, type `Status`. You should see the Chief Architect roster with four Domain Experts loaded. To connect a live instance, follow the optional MCP step in the [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md).

---

## Try it

Once `claude` is running, paste any of these.

**For Business Analysts** — sprint-ready stories:
> *We had a workshop on incident escalation. L1 agents need to escalate to L2 with a reason, notify the on-call engineer, and produce a weekly report. Please give me Gherkin stories. ITSM module, Australia release.*

**For Architects** — integration design:
> *Design the integration that posts resolved P1/P2 incidents from ServiceNow to Azure DevOps. Volume ~100/day, OAuth2, MID Server required.*

**For Developers** — the engine's most distinctive behaviour:
> *Design and implement a custom audit log table for CSM case escalations. Show me the table model.*

The third produces a **pause**, not a table model — the engine surfaces baseline alternatives and asks for your explicit decision. That's §1.1 Baseline-First in action. Full walkthroughs (including live deployment) in the [User Guide](./USER-GUIDE-AND-EXAMPLES.md).

The `.claude/` mirror ships pre-synced and is kept aligned automatically by the pre-commit hook — after `git clone`, no setup is required.
